Kiln
====

**Kiln is an open source multi-platform framework for building and deploying
complex websites whose source content is primarily in XML**. It brings together
various independent software components into an integrated whole that provides
the infrastructure and base functionality for such sites.

Kiln is developed and maintained by a team at the Department of
Digital Humanities (DDH), Kingâ€™s College London. Over the past years
and versions, Kiln has been used to generate more than 50 websites
which have very different source materials and customised
functionality. It has been adapted to work on a variety of flavours of
TEI and other XML vocabularies, and has been used to publish data held
in relational databases.
