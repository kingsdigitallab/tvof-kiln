# tvof-kiln
Contains the Kiln part of the TVOF resource

Content & purpose:
* offline generation of full TEI texts and alignment files (see ./KWIC/tokenise/doall.py)
* Kiln implementation to convert TEI files to HTML and serve them on request (runs on jetty)
* XSLT templates for the TEI to HTML conversion & the resolution of the mapping between texts based on the alignment files

Files:
* webapps/ROOT/stylesheets/tei/to-html.xsl: custom conversion of html to TEI for TVoF
* webapps/ROOT/sitemaps/main.xmap: 

The core material is located in webapps/ROOT/content/xml/tei but it is NOT part of this repository.

* webapps/ROOT/content/xml/tei/alists/TVOF_para_alignment.xml: the full alignment file (TEI)
* webapps/ROOT/content/xml/tei/texts/*.xml: the individual manuscript texts (Royal 20 D, Fr 20125, TEI)

those files are generated by the scripts in /KWIC/tokenise/doall.py from files currently hosted on DropBox.

For development and testing purpose, instead of generating those files you can just copy the latest version from webapps/ROOT/content/xml/tei-archived to webapps/ROOT/content/xml/tei

Tools:

* ./build.sh : starts kiln on your local machine (please don't use that on servers, as they have a permanent jetty service running)
* ./regen-from-dropbox.sh : run on the server to regenerate webapps/ROOT/content/xml/tei/ from DropBox
